Dear sir,
This is a kind request and thanks you so much for being understanding throughout our CDAP journey. It is
mentioned in the CDAP calendar that the tentative dates for pp2 are 14,15 and 18th. Sir hope you
understand our situation as the teams with scheduled pp2 presentations on the 18th are given more time
compared to the groups scheduled for the 14th and 15th. This is a kind request sir it would be really
appreciated if you could consider scheduling on 18,19,20 which is extending by 2 days as this would be a
huge help when considering from the student's point of view while we all get an equal opportunity to
commit fully for pp2.
